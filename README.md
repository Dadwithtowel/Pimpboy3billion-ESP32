# Pimp-Boy 3 Billion (ESP32 Edition)

An ESP32-powered recreation of the Fallout *Pimp-Boy 3 Billion*.  
This project brings the iconic Pip-Boy interface to life with a 4-inch TFT display, animated Vault-Boy GIFs, DFPlayer Mini audio, a 5-position rotary mode selector, and glowing STAT / INV / DATA LEDs.

## LED Details

For this build, ultra-small **0402 SMD LEDs** were used (approx. 0.04 √ó 0.02 √ó 0.017 in.) with fine isolated wire leads (~0.01 in. diameter).  
These fit neatly into the front indicator ports without modifying the model.  
However, **any small LED type** (e.g., 3 mm, 5 mm, or surface-mount variants) can be used as long as current-limiting resistors are applied and wiring is adjusted to suit.

| Function | GPIO Pin |
|-----------|-----------:|
| **STAT LED** | 12 |
| **INV LED** | 13 |
| **DATA LED** | 14 |

## Rotary Switch (5 positions)

The rotary selector‚Äôs **common** connects to **GND**.  
Each position pulls its assigned GPIO **LOW** when selected, switching between Pimp-Boy display modes.

| Function | GPIO Pin |
|-----------|-----------:|
| STATUS | 25 |
| INVENTORY | 26 |
| DATA | 27 |
| CLOCK | 32 |
| RADIO | 33 |

## DFPlayer Mini

| Function | GPIO Pin |
|-----------|-----------:|
| RX (to DFPlayer TX) | 16 |
| TX (to DFPlayer RX) | 17 |

MP3 files are stored on a microSD card inside the DFPlayer.  
Each button press or mode change can trigger playback from a specific track or random folder range, as defined in the code.

| Signal | GPIO Pin (typical) |
|---------|--------------------:|
| MISO | 19 |
| MOSI | 23 |
| SCK | 18 |
| CS / DC / RESET | as defined in `TFT_eSPI/User_Setup.h` |

| Signal | GPIO Pin |
|---------|-----------:|
| SDA | 21 |
| SCL | 22 |

## Wi-Fi & Time Sync

The ESP32 connects to your local Wi-Fi network and uses NTP to synchronize the internal clock.  
Update your credentials in the code:

```cpp
const char *ssid     = "insert SSID HERE"; 
const char *password = "Insert SSID PASSWORD HERE";

Install all required libraries.

Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password at the top of the code.

Upload the sketch to your ESP32.

Wire components as shown in the pinout images above.

Copy your MP3 files into the /MP3 folder on the microSD card used by the DFPlayer.
